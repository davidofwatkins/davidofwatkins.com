# 👋 Hi, I'm David

I write software at a startup in San Francisco called [Zenput](https://www.zenput.com/). I like [making videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/dwat91), playing music, building things, and [pulling pranks](https://youtu.be/uBX6WRxhAKI).

If you're here for my resume, you can find it [here](/assets/downloads/resume.pdf). Otherwise, maybe one of the following is what you're looking for:
