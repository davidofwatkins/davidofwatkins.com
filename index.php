            <p>Greetings, and welcome!</p>
            <p>I'm David Watkins, a Computer Information Technology major and Web Development minor at <a href="http://www.champlain.edu/" target="_blank">Champlain College</a> in Burlington, Vermont. I am a technology enthusiast, though I have a broad range of interests and hobbies, stretching from the arts (music, theatre, video editing, etc.) to software and development, computer networking, and other areas of computing. This is my personal website, so please feel free to stay and explore or visit some of my other profiles elsewhere on the web, should you like to learn more about me.</p>
            <p>Thank you,<br />David Watkins</p>
            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>I grew up in Southern California and attended high school at <a href="http://sagehillschool.org" target="_blank">Sage Hill School</a>. Looking to attend College <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=202400406829683397268.00044781c74c5f1e27392&ll=40.913513,-97.558594&spn=53.919349,82.96875&z=4" target="_blank">in other parts of the country</a>, I ultimately chose Champlain College in Burlington, VT because of its small community, information technology curriculum, and liberal arts core. During my undergraduate career, I've also had the privilege to call Montr&eacute;al my home away from home for one short semester. Overall, I have really enjoyed my time at Champlain.</p>
            <p>For as long as I can remember, technology and electronics have managed to capture my curiosity and interest. I built my first desktop in middle school with a minimal technical understanding of computers, but I've since achieved a greater understanding and appreciation for technology and its drastic effect upon our everyday lives&mdash;which will undoubtedly continue to increase. I am primarily a Windows user, though I have a strong appreciation for Linux as I learn more about it. Recently, I've also become interested in software development (mostly on the web and Android, so far).</p>
            <p>Music has also been a large part of my life. I grew up singing in children's choirs until high school, where I began participating in musicals and plays. Since then, I've begun playing guitar, and I regularly attend singing workshops to train and strengthen my voice. I'll listen to most kinds of music, though I particularly enjoy folky, country, and bluesy styles. I also enjoy video editing and have significant experience doing so in my spare time.</p>
            <p>Regardless of where my future takes me, I hope to continue exploring these interests and others. (You can find some of my projects on my <a href="portfolio">portfolio</a> page.) I believe we live in an exciting era, where the growth of technology has the potential to improve and change our lives in unpredictable and sometimes unimaginable ways.</p>
