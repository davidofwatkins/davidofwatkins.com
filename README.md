## Getting Started

davidofwatkins.com is built using the static site framework, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

This project uses Docker. To start the development server, simply run:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Then open your browser to http://0.0.0.0:4000/.

Changes should restart the server automatically, which you should be able to confirm in the logs. If this doesn't happen, you can restart the container by stopping it with ctrl+c and starting it again with the above command.
