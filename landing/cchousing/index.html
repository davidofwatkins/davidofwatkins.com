                <p>As a Champlain College capstone project, this housing registration web application is a working proof-of-concept for what would allow students to research on-campus living opportunities with details regarding location, room size, roommate possibilities, and more. Likewise, it would allow residential administrators to enter descriptions and upload images and floor plans for each hall using an intuitive and centralized control panel.</p>

                    <h2>Save time: register anywhere, anytime</h2>
                    <p>Champlain College's current registration process involves physical priority numbers, scheduled registration meetings, long lines, and long wait times. This web app replaces this slow, inefficient system with a flexible and fast online alternative. Designed to work like online class registration, students can log in using their normal accounts during their specified window of time from anywhere in the world, whether they be at home, studying abroad, or on campus.</p>

                <div class="col-md-3">
                    <div class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></div>
                    <h2>Make better choices</h2>
                    <p>It's not always easy to pick a residence hall without much information about it. This solution provides an overview of details for a given hall on a single page, allowing students to make more educated decisions at a glance about where they choose to live. This could be especially important for incoming freshmen or transfer students who are not familiar with campus.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-3">
                    <div class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></div>
                    <h2>Collaborate with roommates</h2>
                    <p>It's easy to choose a roommate. Students with earlier registration windows can specify roommates when finalizing their registration and post a short bio about themselves for potential roommates who might register later.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-3">

                    <h2>Administration Benefits: faster, cheaper, more efficient</h2>
                    <p>The Department of Residential Life benefits, too. Administrators can upload pictures and floor plans, link halls with Foursquare locations, override housing assignments, and more all from a centralized control panel - no need to manage events or mail-in registration.</p>
